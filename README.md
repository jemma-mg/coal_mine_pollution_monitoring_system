# Coal Mine Pollution Monitoring System

- A coal mine monitoring system that monitors the temperature, humidity, presence of smoke and gases like methane.
- Coal mine disasters occurs in various parts of the world leading to loss of numerous lives.Coal miners have to work under risky condition and their safety is not assured .Our project helps to monitor any variation from the normal condition inside the coal mine and the miners can take the necessary precautions before going inside the mine 
- In this we make use of temperature and humidity sensor DHT11,Gas sensor MQ2 which detects gases such as methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen etc .It also detects smoke in the surroundings.
- This data from the sensor is sent to the Arduino,which processes the information .
- If there is any variation in any of the values from that of the normally expected values, the buzzer beeps and Lcd display will display the parameter with the variation.
- The LCD also displays the present values of temperature and humidity 


#### Components used:
1. Arduino UNO
2. MQ2 gas sensor
3. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
4. 16x2 LCD display
5. Buzzer
6. Breadboard
7. 1 Kilo-ohm Resistor
8. Connecting wires
